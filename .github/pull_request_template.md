## Auto cherry-pick in API_LEVEL

If requested to port the commits from this PR on a dedicated _API_LEVEL_ branch,
select the targeted one(s), or add new references if not listed:

[ ] TARGET_API_LEVEL: API_LEVEL_22
[ ] TARGET_API_LEVEL: API_LEVEL_23
[ ] TARGET_API_LEVEL: API_LEVEL_24

This will only create the PR with cherry-picks, ready to be reviewed and merged.

Remember:

- The merge will ALWAYS be a manual operation.
- It is possible the cherry-picks don't apply correctly, mainly if previous commits have been forgotten.
- In such case, there is no other solution than do the operation manually...
