--8<-- [start:swap_entry_point_intro]
The handle functions must be defined by each Coin application implementing the SWAP feature.

Handlers are called by Exchange through the `os_lib_call` API, and dispatched by the `main()`
and `library_app_main()` functions of the lib_standard_app.

The Exchange application is responsible for handling the flow and sequencing of the SWAP.
